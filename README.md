🕸️ I have tutored people on schoolhouse.world  about ML and DL for 4 sessions and 204 minutes. Worked with 12 learners from 7 countries. Worked with another tutor for 3 sessions. Got extremely good feedback from all learners with 9 helpfuls and 7 super helpfuls. (https://schoolhouse.world/transcript/d25a544f-b8b9-4505-8bf9-0382099afa94). Feedback included interactive, friendly and good explanations.
