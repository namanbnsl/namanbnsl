## Hi there 👋

I am Naman and I like to code. 🖥️<br />

🔭 I’m currently working on **moose** 🫎.

🕸️ I also have a youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@namanbnsl

⚒️ I have built:
1. moose-mini 🫎 - a simple pretrained llm like chatgpt built to complete stories. trained for cheap on a single v100. around 170m params.
2. moose-dataset - a combined fine-tuning dataset mainly focusing on math and reasoning.
4. newweb - web3 blogging platform with payments
5. lime - easily setup your own ecommerce store with no-code or an api
6. web3 crm(airblock)
7. web3 sdk(airblock)
